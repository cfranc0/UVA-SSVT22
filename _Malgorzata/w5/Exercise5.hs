{-
For this exercise i would use the function from the precious exercises.
For the equivalence of two properties i would look for the properties that kill the same mutants.
I would use the 3D matrices described in the exercise 3 and compared them.

Then, the implications mean for example (1 --> 2) means that the mutants killed for 2 is a subset of the mutants killed for 1.
I would use the strength function for this comparision.
I think this could be done by getting all strengths for every property, order them and for every property, return the properties that are stronger, and that would be the implications.
